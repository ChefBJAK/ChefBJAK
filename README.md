Hi, I'm Brennen Jakeway!
My goal for this page is to be able to post and share my coding projects with the world!
I will be keeping a journal/blog with my progress in new things I learn!
Thank you for visiting and I hope you find my content to be enjoyable.


Currrently Learning Python, Django, ML, and other technologies through NC State Coding bootcamp!
